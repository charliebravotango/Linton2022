# Final Assessment &mdash; Administering a SQL Database Infrastructure
*13 May 2022*
## Assessment objectives
Any candidate achieving a passing grade has demonstrated competence in the following objectives:
- Backup SQL Server databases
- Restore SQL Server databases
- Managing SQL Server using PowerShell
- Trace access to SQL Server
- Monitor SQL Server infrastructure

## Please Note:
1. This assessment is *performance-based*, which means you must perform certain tasks, the results of which will determine whether you pass/fail.
1. This assessment is *open-book*, which means you may use ***any*** reference materials in performing the tasks required. This is meant to simulate the *real world*.
1. This assessment is *time-based*, which means you must accomplish sufficient tasks to accumulate sufficient points to warrant a passing score.
## Prepare the assessment environment
If you have any problems with the following tasks, please contact your instructor.
- [ ] Ensure the lab virtual machine is started
- [ ] Ensure there is ***at least*** 4 hours of remaining lab time  (preferably more)
- [ ] Logon to the 20764C-MIA-SQL computer as `Student`
- [ ] Open *SQL Server Management Studio* `(SSMS)` and logon on to the `DEFAULT` instance of SQL Server Database Engine
- [ ] Breathe :flushed:
